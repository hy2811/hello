										<h5>What are your areas of expertise?</h5>
										
									</header>
									<p>We work from start to finish on both commercial and personal events. These range from product launches, conferences and company award evenings to celebratory birthday, weddings and anniversary events. We’ve worked across all business sectors and are happy to provide references and testimonials.</p>
									<header>
										<h5>What services do you offer?</h5>
										
									</header>
									<p>We offer a comprehensive event planning service. We’re able to find venues, organise catering, décor, accommodation, staffing, equipment and even hire speakers for corporate events. We offer a tailor made service to fit your requirements. Every event is unique and we have the capacity to fulfill your requirements from start to finish.</p>
									<header>
										<h5>What are your fees?</h5>
										
									</header>
									<p>We will discuss all your event requirements before giving a quotation as obviously fees charged will depend on the scale and nature of the event, complexity of planning and our level of involvement. We’ll keep in contact with you regarding our time, hours spent, and liaise with you on specific items, but we’ll also work to your budget and plan accordingly. You’ll never be charged more than we agree upon and there will be no hidden extras or surprises.</p>
									<header>
										<h5>Why do I need an event planning?</h5>
										
									</header>
									<p>An experienced event planner saves you time and money.We will supply reputable suppliers and vendors, negotiate the best rates, discounts, terms and conditions on your behalf and co-ordinate all aspects of your event. Using an event planner takes away stress and worry, and gives you peace of mind to enjoy your event.</p>
									<header>
										<h5>What’s the difference between event design and event planning?</h5>
										
									</header>
									<p><li>Event design and event planning work hand in hand to deliver a successful event. Event design is about bringing your event to life with appropriate colours, themes, seating, etc, whereas event planning co-ordinates the logistic elements and budget management.</li>
									<li>Events by Knight offer tailor made events. This means we incorporate both event design and event planning to create that perfect event.</li></p>
									<header>
										<h5>How do you keep budgets on track?</h5>
										
									</header>
									<p>We are meticulous about keeping track of everything we need to spend money on. This is done by constant monitoring and updating spreadsheets, knowing where to prioritise spending and keeping aside a budget to cater for emergency contingencies.</p>
									<header>
										<h5>What factors do you consider when selecting a venue?</h5>
										
									</header>
									<p>We consider the size and capacity of venue needed for the number of guests, facilities provided, parking, technical needs and budget constraints. We visit venues to check on the quality of the facilities and liaise with clients, keeping them informed of decisions made.</p>
									<header>
										<h5>How early do we need to start planning an event?</h5>
										
									</header>
									<p>Whilst this obviously depends on the size and nature of the event, we’d always advise you to start putting plans in place as early as possible. At certain times of year certain venues may need to be booked well in advance, as too with reputable suppliers and vendors. We advise handing over the reins to an event planner as soon as you’re aware of an event to be planned. This gives us adequate time to factor in back up plans as well as leaving ample time to negotiate, plan and ensure everything’s in place for your big day.</p>
									<header>
										<h5>Can you cope with last minute changes of plan or emergency situations?</h5>
										
									</header>
									<p>We have extensive experience in dealing with the unexpected. We build in contingency measures for all our events and are constantly formulating plans to cope with emergency situations. Rest assured your event is always in the most capable hands.
</p>
									<header>
										<h5>What is your refund and cancellation policy?
</h5>
										
									</header>
									<p><li>We’re aware that sometimes things happen which are outside of your control. In the event of needing a refund for a cancelled event, do discuss this with your event planner as early as possible, before extra services and products may have been ordered. We will discuss our policies with you before entering into contracts and then liaise with you in the unfortunate event of an event being canceled.</li>
									<li>We believe it’s important that all parties are aware of their obligations and responsibilities. This goes a long way towards maintaining professionalism, enjoying healthy relationships with loyal vendors and suppliers and ensuring our customers are always delighted with our service to them.</li>
									<li>As event planning specialists, we totally understand your concerns. We’re always happy to answer any questions you may have and seek to put your mind at rest.</li></p>
